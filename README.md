<h2>Predicting Cardiac Response During Variable-Intensity Exercise Using Long Short-Term Memory</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
In humans, heart rate closely tracks the level of physical exertion, given its vital role in supplying oxygen to muscles. However, a delay exists between exertion and the resulting heart rate adjustment (Noakes, T. 2003). This study delves into the complex relationship between physical exertion and the associated heart rate response delay. The primary objective is to develop an advanced machine learning algorithm capable of accurately predicting heart rate at a future time point, such as
seconds ahead, based on patterns of preceding
seconds.

<h3>Methodology:</h3>
The chosen approach involves training a sophisticated machine learning model using a diverse dataset collected from various settings encompassing a range of intensity levels. This model leverages the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm (Hochreiter, S. and Schmidhuber J. 1997) to forecast heart rate dynamics. The essential data is meticulously gathered from multiple sources, utilizing a variety of sensors. These include a barometer for precise altitude measurement, a speed sensor, a heart rate monitor, a cadence sensor, and a highly sensitive GPS.

<h3>Practical Implications:</h3>

The ability to anticipate an impending heart rate threshold, such as within the upcoming 20 seconds, holds promise for practical applications. This insight empowers individuals to proactively adjust their exertion levels before crossing the threshold, contributing to a more precise maintenance of their desired heart rate. The envisioned pretrained model exhibits significant potential for versatile deployment across a range of devices, from wrist-worn wearables to cutting-edge exercise equipment and cycling technology.
